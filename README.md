# Side Project

#### 31/12/2023

#### By Collins Chirchir

## Project Overview

"The React Quiz" is a quiz application built using React and leverages the power of `useReducer` for state management.
The app fetches questions from a Json Server, allowing users to answer React-related questions within a specified time
limit. The final score is computed based on the accuracy of the answers, and the quiz ends either when all questions are
answered or when the timer runs out.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** The project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **useReducer:** The `useReducer` hook is employed for efficient state management, enabling the application to handle
  complex state logic with ease.
- **Json Server:** Questions for the quiz are fetched from a Json Server, providing a simple and lightweight backend for
  serving quiz content.

## Functionality

- **Quiz Interface:** Users are presented with a user-friendly interface to answer a series of React-related questions.
- **Timer:** A timer is set for each question, creating a time-bound challenge for users.
- **Score Calculation:** The final score is computed based on the accuracy of the answers provided by the user.
- **Quiz Completion:** The quiz ends when all questions are answered or when the timer runs out.
- **Results Display:** After completing the quiz, users are presented with their final score and a summary of their
  performance.
